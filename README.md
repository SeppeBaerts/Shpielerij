I made this to see how far I could push myself in C#, and also because I love coding. 
However, I needed a place to keep all my 'non-school' code projects. (here)
Currently, I am making my own game engine in 'Still_Dunno_What_This_Will_Be'. 
Keep in mind that I only started learning to code in September 2022, so don't set your expectations too high.
